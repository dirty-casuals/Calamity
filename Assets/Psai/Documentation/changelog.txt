=====================================================================================	


2015-05-07  1.6.0
    * dropped support for Unity versions < 5.0
    * fixed occasional timing problems in Unity 5
    * fixed: Unity was not immediately reflecting psai Project changes made in Psai Editor LE due to caching

2015-04-27  1.5.17
    * PsaiSoundtrackLoader will now load psai Project files directly by XML
    * No need to build the soundtrack after changes any more, just save your soundtrack.
        * To load, play or edit a former .psai project file, just rename it to .xml.
        * You can still load .psai files in the psai Editor, but make sure that no files of the same name exist in
            your soundtrack folder (e.g. "MySoundtrack.psai" and "MySoundtrack.xml" will cause problems at runtime,
            as Unity ignores the file extensions when loading from the Resources folder).
        * The binary .bytes file format is deprecated
    * dropped support for Unity versions < 4.6	
    * fixed wrong playback of MIDDLE-Segments after triggering the same Theme again while an END-Segment was playing
    * PsaiStopMusic now allows overriding the default resting time
    * soundtracks will no longer be unloaded between scene transitions if DontDestroyOnLoad() was called on the Psai.prefab
		
2015-02-12  1.5.16
    * fixed occasional timing problems and skipping of Segments on interrupting triggers
    * fixed Inspector for PsaiStopMusic not storing the selected Radiobutton ("by End / by fade-out")
    * replaced PsaiGoRoRest: Use PsaiStopMusic() instead, and select the new option "wake up automatically". 
    * PsaiOneShotTrigger has now the option to reset the 'has fired' flag when the script has been disabled

2015-01-27  1.5.15
    * added Unity 5.0 compatibility
    * added a whole bunch of Trigger scripts that let you integrate and control a soundtrack in your game without any scripting!
        * PsaiOneShotTrigger
        * PsaiGenericTrigger
        * PsaiTriggerOnButtonDown
        * PsaiTriggerOnEnable
        * PsaiGoToRest	
        * PsaiStopMusic
        * PsaiReturnToLastBasicMood
    * introducing TriggerConditions: Just drag them on any GameObject that holds a Trigger component to further define when it should fire:
        * PsaiTcSkipIfNotVisible
        * PsaiTcSkipIfComponentIsDisabled
        * PsaiTcSkipIfThemeTypeIsPlaying
    * PsaiSoundtrackLoader now supports Drag & Drop
    * added customized Inspectors for all Trigger scripts
    * fixed playback of wrong Segments when no Wrappers were used
    * fixed PsaiCore.Instance not reinitializing properly on Level reload
	
2014-12-03  1.5.14
    * psai now supports asynchronous loading of segments on Unity Pro for ultra-smooth performance. To activate, just add PSAI_UNITY_PRO as a scripting define symbol in the the Unity Player Settings.
	
2014-11-27  1.5.13
    * performance gain: psai now uses auto-generated wrapper-objects as a workaround for AudioClips not being streamed from disk. To have them created, just run the psaiMultiAudioObjectEditor on your soundtrack again.
	
2014-11-09  1.5.12  (first public Version in the Asset Store)
    * optimized memory usage  
    * psaiPlayer now disables the trigger buttons for Highlights whenever there's currently no Segment that would be compatible to the Segment that's currently playing.
