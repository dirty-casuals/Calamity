Hello, thank you for downloading the psai® Music Engine!

If you are a first-time-user, to get started please download the free psai Demo Soundtrack from our website
http://wwww.homeofpsai.com, or from the Unity Asset Store. It comes as a .unitypackage and will unpack to 
Assets/Resources/PsaiDemoSoundtrack
The PsaiPlayer prefab is preconfigured so that it will load the soundtrack from that folder.

If you need music, feel free to visit http://www.sonicliberty.com , choose some music and let us know by email (info@homeofpsai.com).
	
if you need help, have a look at the FAQ / troubleshooting section at homeofpsai.com, or contact us at
devsupport@homeofpsai.com

best greetings,
the psai development team
